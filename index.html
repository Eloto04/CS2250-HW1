<h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
<h2>My name is Eli Tolentino, and I am a second-year computer
    science student at Cal Poly Pomona.</h2>

<p>I am from San Diego, and I have been born and raised there
    throughout my entire life.</p>

<p>Here are some of my hobbies:</p>
<ul> #19
    <li>Lifting weights</li>
    <li>Biking (click <a href="biking.html">here</a> for a list of my favorite destinations)</li>
    <li>Running</li>
    <li>Playing video games</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
</ul>

<p>I have had two dogs throughout my life:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="evie.html">Evie</a></li>
    <li><a href="ele.html">Ele</a></li>
</ol>
<small>Sidenote: both their names start with 'E' just like mine does, thanks to my mom (lol)</small> #18

<p>My favorite song as of late: <b>Never Catch Me by Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar</b></p> #17
<audio controls> #15
    <source src="nevercatchme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> #16
</audio>

<p>Lastly, here is a David Goggins quote that I look towards for motivation:</p>
<blockquote><i>"Don't stop when you're tired. Stop when you're done."</i></blockquote> #13, 14
